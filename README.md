[![TeamCity Build Status](https://img.shields.io/teamcity/https/teamcity.knowit.no/e/External_MicrosoftAspNetWebApiExtensionsCompression_General_Release.svg?style=flat-square)](https://teamcity.knowit.no/viewType.html?buildTypeId=External_MicrosoftAspNetWebApiExtensionsCompression_General_Release&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv&branch_External_MicrosoftAspNetWebApiExtensionsCompression_General=__all_branches__)  

Drop-in module for ASP.Net WebAPI that enables `GZip` and `Deflate` support.  
This module is based on [this blog post by Ben Foster](http://benfoster.io/blog/aspnet-web-api-compression) which in turn is based on this blog post by [Kiran Challa](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kiranchalla/archive/2012/09/04/handling-compression-accept-encoding-sample.aspx).  
This code improves on their work by adding several new options, as well as fixing some issues with the original code.

## How to use
### Server side
You need to add the compression handler as the last applied message handler on outgoing requests, and the first one on incoming requests.  
To do that, just add the following line to your `App_Start\WebApiConfig.cs` file after adding all your other message handlers:  
```csharp
GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.MessageHandlers.Insert(0, new ServerCompressionHandler(new GZipCompressor(), new DeflateCompressor()));
```
This will insert the `ServerCompressionHandler` to the request pipeline as the first on incoming requests, and the last on outgoing requests.
  
### Client side
  
#### JavaScript
If you are doing your requests with `JavaScript` you probably don't have to do do anything.  
Just make sure the `gzip` and `deflate` values are included in the `Accept-Encoding` header. (Most browsers do this by default)  
  
#### C\# 
You need to apply the following code when creating your `HttpClient`.  
```csharp
var client = new HttpClient(new ClientCompressionHandler(new GZipCompressor(), new DeflateCompressor()));

client.DefaultRequestHeaders.AcceptEncoding.Add(new StringWithQualityHeaderValue("gzip"));
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.AcceptEncoding.Add(new StringWithQualityHeaderValue("deflate"));
```
  
Thats it! You should now immediately start experiencing smaller payloads when doing GET, POST, PUT, etc.

## Advanced use
#### Skip compression of requests/responses that are smaller than a specified value
By default, both `ServerCompressionHandler` and `ClientCompressionHandler` compress everything larger than `860 bytes`.  
However, this can be overriden by inserting a threshold as the first parameter like this:
```csharp
var serverCompressionHandler = new ServerCompressionHandler(4096, new GZipCompressor(), new DeflateCompressor());
var clientCompressionHandler = new ClientCompressionHandler(4096, new GZipCompressor(), new DeflateCompressor());
```
The above code will skip compression for any request/response that is smaller than `4096 bytes` / `4 kB`.

#### Disable compression for endpoint
It is possible to disable compression for a specific endpoint. Just add the `[Compression(Enabled = false)]` attribute to your endpoint method. (Or the whole controller if you want to disable for all endpoints in it)

#### OWIN Authentication
When using the OWIN Authentication pipeline, you might encounter errors saying that `Server cannot append header after http headers have been sent`. This is a [bug with OWIN](katanaproject.codeplex.com/discussions/540202), but as of this moment it has not been fixed.  

The workaround is to install the [Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Extensions.Compression.Server.Owin](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Extensions.Compression.Server.Owin/) package and use the included `OwinServerCompressionHandler` instead of the default `ServerCompressionHandler`. This class contains code to detect whether the headers have been sent already and prevent any attempts at compression.
